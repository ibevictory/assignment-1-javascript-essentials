        // Question 1
//  What will the code below output to the console and why ?



console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
// ans = 122  *because is a string concatenation. meaning the adding of one string to the end of another string

console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
// ans = 32  *because the first two values are added while the last value is concated

console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
// ans = 02 * because the first two values would be deducted and the last  value cocated

console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
// ans = 112 * because it is a string all the values are concated

console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
// ans = NaN2 * arithmetic operation is not performed for characters so it will display NotaNumber(NaN) and then concat "2"

console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
// ans = NaN *arithmetic operation is not performed for characters so it will display NotaNumber(NaN) and final integer would not be concated
